Black Box Neural Network Modelling of Guitar Amplifiers and Effect Pedals

## Overview
This project was inspired by an interest in Neural Models for guitar effects after my friend introduced me to Neural DSP Plugins. 
As a data scientist and guitar player with an interest in messing around with pedal and amp electronics, this project was a natural choice.
It was originally for my DS340 AI/ML Final Project, but I've decided to take it further.

The paper [Real-Time Guitar Amplifier Emulation with Deep Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/3/766) helped inspire initial architectures and experiments, but my version has been modified.

All the work done is for Educational and Personal use.
